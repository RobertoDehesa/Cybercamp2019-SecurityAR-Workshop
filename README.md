# Cybercamp2019-Cybersecurity-with-AR
Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that allows us to show digital objects inside the physical reality using a special set of glasses or a smartphone. This appealing technology is closer than ever and in this workshop we would like to anticipate the future in an exercise of innovation. You will not only learn how this technology works and some keys to keep in mind when working with it but also how to develop different solutions to make our physical spaces more secure digitally.

# Contents

## Teory
1. Presentation: Presentation about AR and the security concerns.
## Exercices
1. PoC0: Create your first AR project with AR.js
2. PoC1: Secure WiFi stickers to protect your network from uninvited guests.
3. PoC2: Watermarking documents with AR and checking the data integrity.

# Structure

Each exercice directory will contain two folders:
- Exercice: The scafolding of the project with comented code and some gaps to fill during the workshop.
